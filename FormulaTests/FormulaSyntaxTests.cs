    ///         In 2025, the MSTest framework has been updated to include the ability to
    ///         check for exceptions using the Assert.ThrowsExactly method (thus on a line
    ///         by line basis inside of a test).  This replaces the old way of
    ///         using the [ExpectedException] attribute which also would tell the test
    ///         that the code should throw an exception, and if it doesn't an error has occurred;
    ///         i.e., the correct implementation of the constructor should result
    ///         in this exception being thrown based on the given poorly formed formula.
    ///         You can remove the commented out code below once you understand the difference.
    ///       </item>
    ///       <item>
    ///         When using the ThrowsExactly method, you must use a lambda expression. A lambda
    ///         expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can contain expressions
    ///         and statements.  We will learn more about lambda expressions later in the course.
    ///       </item>
    ///       <item>
    ///         When testing a constructor, and where you don't need the result of the constructor,
    ///         you can use the discard notation (i.e., an underscore):
    ///         <example>
    ///           <code>
    ///             _ = new Formula( "5+5" );
    ///           </code>
    ///         </example>
    ///       </item>
